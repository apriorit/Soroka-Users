# Composition
 
### 1. Create docker network

 `$ docker network create <your_network_name_here>`

### 2. Create TLS certificate

You can create a self-signed TLS certificate.

cd into [/composition/service](./composition/service) directory and run:

`$openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -x509 -sha256 -days 365 -nodes -out yourKey.crt -keyout yourKey.key`


 ### 3. Run service

cd into composition directory and run the folowing script:
 
 `$ ./compile_service.sh`

It builds the project on your machine, adds service binary to docker image and spins up all the components mentioned in [composition/docker-compose.yml](./composition/docker-compose.yml) inside of docker.

To verify that all is running as expected try to reach the service on exposed port:

`http://localhost:8443/some_endpoint`
